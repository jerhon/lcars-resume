The goal of this repository was to try out the Parcel web bundler with React and Typescript.

This is a make believe resume for the fictitious LCARS interface.
I had always wanted to make a mockup LCARS interface since I've been a big trek fan since I was a teenager.

If you wish, feel free to fork and take your resume to the 24th century.
I take no responsibility for the outcome of submitting a resume in this format. :D

## To Develop 

Starts Parcel in development mode.
It has hot reloading, but it doesn't always work right.

```
npm start
```


## To Build

Uses Parcel to build the bundle.
Output is in the dist folder.

```
npm run build
```

Output will be in the dist folder.
